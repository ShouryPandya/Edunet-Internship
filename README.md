# Image Steganography in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates an Image Steganography tool implemented in Python, allowing users to embed secret messages within images for secure communication. The application provides an easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting messages hidden inside image files using a passcode for security.

## Features
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages**: Hide and retrieve secret messages inside images.
- **Passcode Protection**: Secure encryption and decryption using a passcode.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Image File Support**: Works with standard image formats like JPG and PNG.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - NumPy (for data handling)
  - OS (for file operations)
- **Platform Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Development Environment**: VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Steganography-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Image-Steganography-Python
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python steganography.py
   ```

## Usage
### Encrypt a Message:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter a message and passcode.
3. The message is stored inside the image.
4. The encrypted image is saved.

### Decrypt a Message:
1. Run the script.
2. Select the encrypted image.
3. Enter the correct passcode.
4. The hidden message is retrieved.
